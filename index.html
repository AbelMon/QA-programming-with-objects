                <h2>What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>
                <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.</p>
                <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this"). In OO programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] There is significant diversity in object-oriented programming, but most popular languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determines their type.</p>

                <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <p>The concept of a data class makes it possible to define subclasses of data objects that share some or all of the main class characteristics. Called inheritance, this property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time, and ensures more accurate coding.</p>
                <p>Since a class defines only the data it needs to be concerned with, when an instance of that class (an object) is run, the code will not be able to accidentally access other program data. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater system security and avoids unintended data corruption.</p>
                <p>The definition of a class is reuseable not only by the program for which it is initially created but also by other object-oriented programs (and, for this reason, can be more easily distributed for use in networks).</p>
                <p>The concept of data classes allows a programmer to create any new data type that is not already defined in the language itself.</p>

                <h2>What Is an Object?</h2>
                <p>Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.</p>
                <p>Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail). Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes). Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.</p>
                <p>Take a minute right now to observe the real-world objects that are in your immediate area. For each object that you see, ask yourself two questions: "What possible states can this object be in?" and "What possible behavior can this object perform?". Make sure to write down your observations. As you do, you'll notice that real-world objects vary in complexity; your desktop lamp may have only two possible states (on and off) and two possible behaviors (turn on, turn off), but your desktop radio might have additional states (on, off, current volume, current station) and behavior (turn on, turn off, increase volume, decrease volume, seek, scan, and tune). You may also notice that some objects, in turn, will also contain other objects. These real-world observations all translate into the world of object-oriented programming.</p>

                <p>Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior. An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages). Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication. Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation — a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.</p>
                <p>Consider a bicycle, for example:</p>

                <h2>Class</h2>
                <p>In object-oriented programming , a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object . Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.</p>
                <p>The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming. Among the important ideas about classes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A class can have subclasses that can inherit all or some of the characteristics of the class. In relation to each subclass, the class becomes the superclass.</li>
                    <li>Subclasses can also define their own methods and variables that are not part of their superclass.</li>
                    <li>The structure of a class and its subclasses is called the class hierarchy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What is an instance?</h2>
                <p>An instance, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is a specific realization of any object. An object may be varied in a number of ways. Each realized variation of that object is an instance. The creation of a realized instance is called instantiation.</p>
                <p>Each time a program runs, it is an instance of that program. In languages that create objects from classes, an object is an instantiation of a class. That is, it is a member of a given class that has specified values rather than variables. In a non-programming context, you could think of "dog" as a class and your particular dog as an instance of that class.</p>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <p>In object-oriented programming, a procedure that is executed when an object receives a message. A method is really the same as a procedure, function , or routine in procedural programming languages. The only difference is that in object-oriented programming, a method is always associated with a class.</p>

                <h2>Module</h2>
                <p>A module is a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines. One or more independently developed modules make up a program. An enterprise-level software application may contain several different modules, and each module serves unique and separate business operations.</p>
                <p>Modules make a programmer's job easy by allowing the programmer to focus on only one area of the functionality of the software application. Modules are typically incorporated into the program (software) through interfaces.</p>

                <h2>Python modules</h2>
                <p>A module is a python file that (generally) has only defenitions of variables, functions, and classes. For example, a module might look like this:</p>
                <img src="images/module.png" alt="module example">
                <p>As you see, a module looks pretty much like your normal python program.</p>
                <p>So what do we do with a module? We <em>import</em> bits of it (or all of it) into other programs.</p>
                <p>To import all the variables, functions and classes from moduletest.py into another program you are writing, we use the import operator. For example, to import moduletest.py into your main program, you would have this:</p>

                <h2>Library</h2>
                <p>A program library is a collection of (usually) precompiled, reusable programming routines that a programmer can "call" when writing code so that the programmer doesn't have to write it. A dynamic link library (DLL) is one type of program library. Another type of program library is a class library, whose stored routines are class definitions in object-oriented programming (OOP). Graphical user interface (GUI) components such as scroll bars, buttons, and windowing routines are generally stored in a class library.</p>

                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the » W3C, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.</p>
                    <p>The definition of HTML is <b>HyperText Markup Language.</b> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.</li>
                        <li>Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).</li>
                        <li>HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.</li>
